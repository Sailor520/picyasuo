                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>JPG to Small was created with a simple mission: to provide everyone with a fast, secure, and easy way to compress images without compromising quality. In today's digital world, image optimization is crucial for website performance, social media sharing, and efficient storage management.</p>
                
                <p>We recognized that many existing image compression tools either require software installation, charge fees, or compromise user privacy by uploading files to servers. That's why we built JPG to Small as a completely browser-based solution that processes everything locally on your device.</p>
